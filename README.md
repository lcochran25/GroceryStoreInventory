# GroceryStoreInventory

I designed this program by using three files; a header file with the Grocery Store class that has private and public members. The public members are a constructor, mutators and accessors. This allows us to get and set information from the grocery list for tracking. 
 
The .cpp file that sets and returns values for item name and quantity of item were set up to work with the class file above. 
 
In the main file, I implemented functions. The functions create a backup file, count the items, and return the items in a list when searched for. Under the “main” function, I displayed the selection menu for the user to select what they want to do.  
This allows the users to check the quantity of items. I used a while loop with switch statements to manage the user selections and perform the actions that the user selects. There are (4) cases in the switch statements to choose from with a default case for invalid entries. Case 4 exits the program when the user is finished. 
 
In conclusion, this program will allow users to search for items they are looking for to see how much is in stock. If the item is not listed, it will advise the user that the item does not exist. The user can print a histogram of the listed items as well as a list of the items with numerical quantities for each item. This will allow anyone to see everything that is currently in stock with the amount in stock. This will be useful for store management to easily track their inventory. This program is also scalable to fit the growing needs of the Corner Grocer in the future.
